# python-challenge

In the completion of this module challenge, I utilized various resources to enhance my understanding and provide thorough solutions. I would like to acknowledge the following assistance: AI Assistance: I used Microsoft Copilot, an AI companion created by Microsoft, to help me understand complex concepts, generate code snippets, and troubleshoot errors. This tool was instrumental in clarifying doubts and ensuring the accuracy of my work. I ensured that all code and solutions were thoroughly reviewed, tested, and understood. I adapted and customized the provided information to meet the specific requirements of the assignment.

I created Workflow files (later deleted) and studied about Unit Test, in order to ensure error free submission of my work. I worked extensively on github- directories,push, pull etc and on numerous occasions I had to commit changes.
